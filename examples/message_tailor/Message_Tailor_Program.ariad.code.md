To implement the "Message Tailor Program" as described in your YAML definition, we'll divide it into discrete Python components. Given the YAML outlines a complex system involving data access, message personalization using members' data, and integration with external communication platforms, we'd structure the program as follows:

### server_api.py
This module will simulate the Server API that hosts team/group and member data.

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Dummy data for the demonstration
teams_data = {
    "Team A": ["Member1", "Member2", "Member3"],
    "Team B": ["Member4", "Member5", "Member6"],
    "Team C": ["Member7", "Member8", "Member9"]
}

member_preferences_data = {
    "Member1": {"Name": "John", "Preferences": {"Interest": "Cycling", "Topic": "Tour de France"}},
    "Member2": {"Name": "Doe", "Preferences": {"Interest": "Programming", "Topic": "Python"}},
    "Member3": {"Name": "Smith", "Preferences": {"Interest": "Reading", "Topic": "Classical Novels"}},
    # Extend for other members...
}

@app.route('/teams', methods=['GET'])
def get_teams():
    """Endpoint to get the list of teams."""
    return jsonify(list(teams_data.keys()))

@app.route('/members/<team>', methods=['GET'])
def get_members(team):
    """Endpoint to get the list of members in a specific team."""
    if team in teams_data:
        return jsonify(teams_data[team])
    return jsonify([]), 404

@app.route('/preferences/<member>', methods=['GET'])
def get_member_preferences(member):
    """Endpoint to get preferences for a specific member."""
    if member in member_preferences_data:
        return jsonify(member_preferences_data[member])
    return jsonify({}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

### data_access.py
This module retrieves team/member data from the server API.

```python
import requests

def get_teams():
    response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/teams')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    return []

def get_members(team_name):
    response = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5000/members/{team_name}')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    return []

def get_member_preferences(member_name):
    response = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5000/preferences/{member_name}')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    return {}
```

### personalization_engine.py
Generates personalized messages for individuals based on their preferences.

```python
def generate_personalized_message(member_data):
    name = member_data.get('Name')
    interest = member_data.get('Preferences', {}).get('Interest')
    topic = member_data.get('Preferences', {}).get('Topic')
    
    return f"Hello, {name}! Based on your interest in {interest}, we thought you'd like to know about {topic}."
```

### integration_layer.py
Placeholder for the integration with communication platforms like WhatsApp. This implies using specific APIs or services for sending messages which require actual communication platform accounts and configurations.

```python
def send_personalized_message(recipient, message):
    # This function would integrate with a specific service or API to send the message.
    # The actual implementation would depend on the specific service (e.g., WhatsApp Business API).
    print(f"Sending message to {recipient}: {message}")
    return "Message sent successfully"
```

### main.py
Glues the process together, running a demonstration of the workflow.

```python
import data_access
from personalization_engine import generate_personalized_message
from integration_layer import send_personalized_message

# Retrieve teams
teams = data_access.get_teams()

# Process for each team
for team in teams:
    # Retrieve members for the team
    members = data_access.get_members(team)
    for member in members:
        # Retrieve member preferences
        member_data = data_access.get_member_preferences(member)

        # Generate personalized message
        message = generate_personalized_message(member_data)

        # Send message (placeholder code)
        status = send_personalized_message(member, message)
        print(f"Status for {member}: {status}")
```

Given the complexity and the interaction with external systems (like a server API and a communication platform such as WhatsApp), the above code provides a foundational framework. Actual interaction, such as sending real messages through WhatsApp, requires using specific APIs (e.g., Twilio for WhatsApp) and appropriate configuration and credentials.
